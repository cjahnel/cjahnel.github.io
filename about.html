          <h3>Math</h3>
          <p>I am in love with math. Over the past two years, I challenged myself by completing all high school math courses to gain credit. 
            Outside of school, I studied AP Calculus AB as a freshman, going on to receive a 5, and AP Calculus BC and AP Statistics as a sophomore. 
            Currently, I am studying Linear Algebra. You can find me on Khan Academy (through which I do all my self-studying) in my <i>Find Me</i> tab.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="programming">
          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I had my first taste of basic html when I was in elementary school 
            but it wasn't until middle school when I actually developed an interest in programming. 
            I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but since then I've had some experience with JQuery and AJAX, Node.js, SQL, Python, and I learned Bootstrap to make this very website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="science">
          <h3>Science</h3>
          <p>Like most people into math, I took an interest into science, specifically physics and astronomy. 
            While I still have a lot to learn, I hope to expand my knowledge on the different sciences on Khan Academy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="reading">
          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>As a kid, I would read a lot and I was specifically into biographies and realistic fiction. 
            However, over the past couple of years, I've revived my reading habit but in different genres. 
            Today, I'm most interested in science fiction books or books on philosophy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="basketball">
          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>While learning is my passion, I really enjoy playing basketball. 
            I was never very good as a kid but after some coordination and lots of practice, I improved significantly.
            Today, I am on my school's varsity basketball team and we managed to win a sectional championship this year.</p>
